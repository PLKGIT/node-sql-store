# Node.js & MySQL Assignment: Amazon-Style Store
Bootcamp Homework #10

## Overview
This project creates an Amazon-like storefront and application using Node and MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. It will also track product sales across the store's department and provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

### Features

### Technologies Used
  * Node JS v12.13.0
  * Inquirer Node Package Manager (NPM) v7.0.4
  * MySQL NPM v2.18.1
  * Table NPM v5.4.6

### Using MyStore
